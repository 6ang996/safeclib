Changes in vxx092017 2.1.1
        - Install bin/check_for_unsafe_apis. Renamed and improved: 7x faster,
          added missing conversion hints. also install its man1.
        - Seperated internal libstdunsafe target, for std but unsafe C11
          functions: snprintf_s, vsnprintf_s, tmpnam_s
        - Rearranged src layout
        - Macrofied many more tests
        - Improved some tests for old gcc -ansi (c89) memcmp

Changes in v30082017 2.1.1
        - Added vsprintf_s, vsnprintf_s. They are C11.
        - Fixed travis smoking with different compilers.
        - Fixed test with wrong -fsanitize=address strcmp() results.
          asan returns just sgn(strcmp()), not the position.
        - Macrofied some tests, use probed stdlib defines for fallbacks,
          and add missing headers.
        - Added empty stubs for all missing safe C11 functions
        - Fixed C++ support for sprintf* and bool. Resolve restrict from
        config.h before the header declarations.

Changes in v25082017 2.1.0
        - Fixed many tests. They were not enabled at all. See #10.
        sprintf_s, snprintf_s, memcpy16_s, memcpy32_s,
        memmove_s, memmove16_s, memmove32_s, memset_s,
        strcpyfldout_s, strljustify_s,
        - Changed some errors: Throw ESLEMAX when smax exceeds max,
        before the smax>dmax check (ESNOSPC):
        memcpy_s, memcpy16_s, memcpy32_s, memcmp_s, memcmp16_s,
        memcmp32_s, memmove_s, memmove16_s, memmov32_s.
        - Reverted a strljustify_s change by me.
        - Document that memset_s on C11 allows n = ZERO, and
        ESNULLP will be EINVAL
        - --enable-debug on Darwin disables shared
        - add snprintf_s, which is the unsafe variant of sprintf_s

Changes in v24082017 2.0.1
        - Added man (3) pages and proper documentation.
        See https://rurban.github.io/safeclib/
        - Added a safe_config.h for some new configure options:
        strmax, memmax, nullstack and STRTOK_DELIM_MAX_LEN

Changes in v15082017 2.0.0
        - Add restrict to all pointer args, where applicable
        - Change ESLEMAX to ESNOSPC for `(smax > dmax)` overflows
        - Made it -Wall -pedantic safe
        - Fix strljustify_s for empty src
        - Fix various test errors: wrong printf format types, mostly on 64bit.
        uninitialized variables, wrong variable types, wrong variables.
        - test_strcspn_s.c: fix for g++
        - Fixup sprintf_s: Use the established API, call the str_constraint_handler,
        return the proper error values. Add tests.
        - Add guards to prevent name mangleing when headers are used in c++ code.
        - change memset_s to __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__
        - memset16_s, memset32_s: change API analog to memset_s.
        Also add the smax C11 argument there, to be consistent.
        smax denotes the max. number of bytes, the max size.
        - add missing AM_PROG_AR to configure.ac

Changes in v10052013 1.0.0
        - Autogenerate safe_lib_errno.h safe_types.h
        - use C99 stdbool instead of boolean_t, replace TRUE/FALSE with true/false

Changes in v04122012 1.0.0
        - Update documentation
        - Support slkm: linux kernel module

Changes in v08112011 0.0
        - autotoolized
        - taken from http://sourceforge.net/projects/safeclib/
